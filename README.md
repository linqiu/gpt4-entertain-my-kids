prompts that started as a lego game that turned into a racing game

Prompt 1:
```
I want to play this game on some of the spring break days.
I want to play a video game on there.
The colors I want are Teal, light blue, purple, pink, green, and red.
I want the shapes to be rectangle and triangle.
```

Prompt 2: (I asked them to say something nice)
```
I love you. But every time we click on the canvas, the shape goes into a different place. Can we have the shape show up under where we clicked? Also, the rectangle is a square! Can we have regular rectangles too?
```

Prompt 3:
```
This game is boring. I want a game where I can race and pick my character.
```

Prompt 4: (I got more excited than them...)
```
Okay! This is a start. What if once we click on a character, the other blocks will race against us? Also, can you randomize their speed every loop? and give us the ability to move right only? and can you add a finishing line. once a color gets to the finishing line please announce the winner in an alert. and if we are the winners, play confetti!
```

Prompt 5: (They left to play mario kart)
```
The countdown is being called correctly but I'm not seeing it displayed. Is it drawing in the wrong zindex or something?
```

Prompt 6:
```
I actually changed your function to be called after the select character input is handled. So the callback I pass in is a function that changes a global boolean that tells the gameloop to draw the animation of the characters.
```

Prompt 7: (this fixed it)
```
That's exactly what I've done but the countdown timer still isn't showing up. But I know it's being called.
```
